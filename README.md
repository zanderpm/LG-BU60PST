Plugin for LG Projector BU60PST - Serial Control

This plugin will control an LG BU60PST, and possibly some other LG projectors, over an RS-232 connection.

The plugin should work out of the box, but if you have connection issues, make sure the SetID in the plugin matches the SetID of the projector you are trying to control.  

Tested using the DB-9 option on the projector. USB was not tested, but will likely work. Keep in mind that the projector cannot be powered on remotly through a USB connection.
